Due to Xamarin for Mac not having the ability to create a Photo Projects Extension.

I started working on creating a template project. 

The extension is currently showing in Photo's as expected however the GetSupportedProjectTypes does not seem to be called and not sure what should be done to implement it. I have seen PHProjectExtensionController_Extensions which is a static class but not sure where that comes into play?
